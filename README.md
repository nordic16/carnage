# Carnage - the workout tracker

Carnage is a simple yet **reliable** workout tracker written by someone who's obsessed with lifting and maximizing hypertrophy!

It has all the features most workout trackers do, except none of them are or will be blocked behind a paywall!

# When will the project be complete?

I don't know. I started this way back when my experience with Rails was nearly 0 (and it hasn't increased much since), so not only will I have to finish the project, but I will also need to rewrite a bunch of old code.

# Isn't tracking workouts on a computer kind of counter-intuitive?
This question is one that I had throughout the first few months of development and the answer is yes. In order to solve this I had the idea of first developing a web app that can provide basic functionality, such as routine creation and develop native mobile apps later to provide the latter and the remaining features, such as editing workouts, etc.
